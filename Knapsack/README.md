## Knapsack

A Knapsack is best described by an example. Imagine you have some packages that you have to deliver in your delivery truck. Each package you have to deliver has two aspects: priority and weight. You should deliver all your packages but it turns out that the sum of all the available packages exceeds the maximum weight you can carry in your truck. You have to make a decision, which packages to take. 

This is often called the Knapsack problem. The Knapsack data structure is a container that can hold items of some type and has a fixed weight limit (can hold a maximum weight). The problem is to fill the Knapsack up to (but not over) its maximum weight while maximizing its priority
