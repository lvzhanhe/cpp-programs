## TriMap

We have done work with an STL map, a way to map a key to a value. But there are some restrictions on a map. You can search a map for a key (and then the associated value) but you cannot search a map for a value (and then the associated key). Furthermore, because a map is kept in a particular order, an ordering based on the keys, we cannot know the order of insertion of each element. I am going to fix all that with a new STL-like data structure, the **TriMap**.
